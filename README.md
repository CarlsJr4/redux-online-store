## Live Project: [ShoeShack](https://cdungca.com/projects/shoeshack)

See [**State management with Redux**](https://github.com/CarlsJr4/shoeShack/tree/master/src/redux)

A tiny shoe store app that sells a variety of different colored products. This is a simplified cart application that calculates a cart subtotal and applies a small percentage as tax to the total. Interact with the app using the buttons and dropdown menus. The checkout button does not charge the user, and exists for aesthetic purposes.
